As our whole nation is fighting with covid-19 so for strictly maintaining social distancing I came up with this project as a simple solution. It is a Arduino based indicating and alarming system.
So, Project components are:
1) Arduino UNO (Microprocessor)
2) Ultra sonic sensor(It can detect the presence of any object within a specified distance)
3) Buzzer
4) Neo-pixel ring(A ring of 12 LED lights)
S0, basically here as much close as the object will come the number of LED will start to glow. As we have 12 LED lights and I divided it in 4 different colours. For first 4 colours will be green, then yellow, red, blue respectively and after covering all this if the object comes within a close range of 120 cm to the sensor then Buzzer starts to ring.
